(1) What is JAVA?:
------------------
 Java is a high level object oriented programming (OOP) language.

(2) Some features of JAVA:
--------------------------
 1. Simple and easy to learn.(Due to syntactical similarities with C/C++.)
 2. Robust (Strongly typed language. Exception Handeling.) 
 3. Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Language.
 4. Plaform Independent (Write Once Run Anywhere)
 5. Architecture Neutral. (Size of any type of data is always same in any OS architecture.)
 6. Portable (As byte code is portable.)
 7. Secure (As pointer pointes to memory address, it does not have any pointer support like C/C++.)
 8. Multithreaded (Multithreading -> Multiple threads/processess/tasks running at same time.)

(3) What is OOP?/Features of OOP:
---------------------------------
 1. Abstraction (Hiding the Implementation.)
 2. Encapsulation [Binding the data(/variables/state/properties) and behaviour(/methods/functions) in a single unit.]
 3. Inheritance (Inheriting the properties and behaviours from parent class to child class. 
                 Facilitates "Code Reusability".)
 4. Polymorphism ["One action in many ways." 
                  Methods/Functions having same name and same functions but, 
                  different implementations(logic) and/or different parameters.]
 5. Exception Handling [Execption -> An abnormal condition that disrupts the program in execution.
    Broad definition of "Exception": "An abnormal condition that occurs during a program execution 
    and disrupts the normal flow of instructions."]
