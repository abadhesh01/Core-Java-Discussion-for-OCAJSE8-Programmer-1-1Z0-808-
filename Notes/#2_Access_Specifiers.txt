[1] Access Specifiers:
----------------------
-> Definition: "Access specifiers determine the visibility/accessibility limit for data member(s) and function(s) of a class."
-> Also called as "access modifiers" or "visibility modifiers".
-> There are 4 access specifiers in Java.
   
   Following are the access specifiers in the order of their visibility limit:

   Sl.No.          Access Specifier Name          Visibility / Accessibility Limit
   ------          ---------------------          --------------------------------
     1             private                        Within the class (Lowest Visibility).          
     2             default / no-access            Within the package.
     3             protected                      Within the package and outside the package through inheritance.
     4             public                         Accessed anywhere (Highest Visibility).

 
[2] PIC Rule:
-------------
  P-> 'package' declareation first. There can be only one 'package' declaration in a single .java file.
  I-> 'import' declaration(s). There can be multiple 'import' statements in a single .java file.
  C-> 'class' declaration(s). There can be multiple 'class' declarations in a single .java file but, only one class can be declared 
       as 'public' and it's name should be the same as the .java file name.

[3] What is blocks in Java?
---------------------------
-> Definition: "A block is simply two curly braces (one open and anathor close) without any declaration and may conatain some code(s)/statement(s)."
-> There are 2 types of blocks in java. They are -
   1. "static" block (Block declared as "static"). [Note: "static" blocks, variables and methods are loaded during class loading.]
   2. non-"static" block.

[4] Order of execution:
-----------------------
 1. "static" blocks in the order they are present.
 2. main() method.
 3. If constructor is called with 'new' keyword in main method then,
                   1. non-"static" blocks in the order they are present.
                   2. constructor.
