                                                 Variables in Java
                                                 -----------------
 There are 3 types of variables in Java:
 (1) Local variable
       * Scope/Where it is defined? 
         Ans: "Within a method and/or within a block("static" block, non-"static" block)."  
       * Can it be accessed ouside the scope where it is defined? Ans: "No"
       * Can it be declared as "static"? Ans: "No"
       * Can we provide access specifier/visibility modifier for it? Ans: "No" 
       * Can it be declares as "final"? Ans: "Yes"
 (2) Instance variable (Non-local variable)
       * Scope/Where it is defined?
         Ans: "Within the class and outside the method/block."
       * Can it be declared as "static"?: Ans: "Yes"
       * Can we provide access specifier/visibility modifier for it? Ans: "Yes"
       * Can it be declares as "final"? Ans: "Yes"
 (3) "static" variable (Non-local variable)
       * Scope/Where it is defined?
         Ans: "Within the class and outside the method/block."
       * Can we provide access specifier/visibility modifier for it? Ans: "Yes"
       * Can it be declares as "final"? Ans: "Yes" 

 Conclusion:
 -----------
 -> A local variable is declared within a method or block("static" block, non-"static" block).
 -> A local variable has it's life within the block and cannot be accessed/visible outside the block where 
    it's defined.
 -> Both instance and "static" variables are defined within a class and outside the methods/blocks. 
 -> We can use access specifiers for non-local variables ("static" variables and instance variables) only.
 -> Any instance variable can be modified as "static" variable.
 -> We can declare any variable as "final".
